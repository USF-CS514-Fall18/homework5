# Homework 5
Due: September 28, 11:59pm

Use the following link to to create your private github repository for this assignment: [a link](https://classroom.github.com/a/-yThwjrI)
The repository will be seeded with the skeleton code and testing code. 


In this assingment, you will practice working with linked lists. Fill in code in the following methods of class LinkedList in package linkedList:
- toString, 
- getElement, 
- sumElementsAtEvenIndices(),
- removeNodes, 
- reverse, 
- removeLastOccurrence
- addNumber

The comment above each method describes what the method is supposed to do. Please note that you are not allowed to use Java's 
built-in LinkedList class from java.util, and arrays, ArrayLists, maps and sets too. 
You are not allowed to use extra memory in any of the methods, except for a couple of integer variables and a couple of variables of type Node.
Do NOT change the signatures of the methods (type and number of parameters) or the tests. 

### Testing
Class LinkedListTester has been provided to you, but it tests only the most basic functionality of each method, please make sure to do additional testing
for each method. If you want to add your own tests, please add them in a different test file.  Passing the tests does not garantee that your code is bug-free!

### Submission Instructions

- Your code must (a) compile without any errors, (b) run, (c) pass the tests and (d) implement each method correctly according to the javadoc. 
 If the code does not compile or crashes when we run it on a lab machine, it will result in a 0 for the assignment. 
 - Your code needs to be committed to the correct github repository. Note that we cannot accept code submitted via Canvas or email. 
- Make sure your code follows the style guidelines described in StyleGuidelines.pdf (posted on Canvas). 
- This assignment is individual, no collaboration is allowed. You can go the professor, the TA or CS tutors for help. 
- Please note that you are not allowed to use the web for completing this assignment, except for using Java 8 API and instructor's examples and notes. 
Looking at solutions or partial solutions on the web (even if you don't submit this code!) is considered cheating.
